# Welcome to my repository for ops 201 code challenges!
# What is this?:
- This repository is for the challenges I was assigned during my ops-201 course in Code fellows.
- The purpose of practicing our coding skills is to get an edge over other candidates for potential job opportunities. These Challenges have helped us understand how we can create scripts/code to perform tasks at a much faster rate as opposed to not using scripts at all.
- During my time in Ops 201, I learned the fundamentals of bash and powershell. 
- My favorite Challenge is the ipv4string.ps1 file that is in this repository. I feel this is the point in where I had a clearer grasp on creating scripts and was more comfortable using powershell/bash
- These coding challenegs could prove useful in the workplace by gathering information easily, skipping the GUI and navigating the pathways through a terminal to create or transfer files, automating files to be transferred from server to server, etc.
-  A script I would like to improve over time is my challenge4ex.sh script. I was overcomplicating the creation of this script, and would try to make it as simple as I could.
-  I am looking forward to tackling more complex shell scripting challenges and using more cmdlets to understand how they work more.
